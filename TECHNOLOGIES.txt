- Document Templates: Using existing PDFs as templates for new documents
- Form Filling: Populating PDF forms with client data
- Document Merging: Combining multiple PDFs into single documents
- Watermarking: Adding stamps or watermarks to existing PDFs

2. FRONTEND TECHNOLOGIES
------------------------

2.1 Build System
- Vite: Modern, fast build tool that provides instant hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds
- Why Vite over Webpack: Significantly faster development server startup and HMR, better out-of-the-box configuration

2.2 CSS Framework
- Tailwind CSS 4.0: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- Why Tailwind: 
  - Consistent design system
  - Small production bundle size (only used utilities are included)
  - Excellent developer experience with utility classes
  - Easy to maintain and customize

2.3 JavaScript Libraries
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for API communication
- Dropzone.js: Drag-and-drop file upload functionality with progress tracking
- FSLightbox: Lightweight image gallery for document previews

3. DATABASE ARCHITECTURE
------------------------

3.1 Database Support
- Multi-database support (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
- SQLite as default for easy development setup
- MySQL/PostgreSQL recommended for production

3.2 Database Design
- Multi-tenant architecture with Organizations
- Relational structure with proper foreign keys and indexes
- Soft deletes for data recovery
- Timestamps for audit trails

4. DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
--------------------

4.1 Testing
- Pest PHP: Modern testing framework with expressive syntax
- Why Pest: Cleaner syntax than PHPUnit, better Laravel integration, faster test execution

4.2 Code Quality
- Laravel Pint: Opinionated PHP code formatter based on PHP-CS-Fixer
- Laravel Debugbar: Development toolbar for debugging queries, performance, and requests
- Laravel Pail: Real-time log viewer for development

4.3 Development Environment
- Laravel Sail: Docker-based development environment
- Why Sail: Consistent development environment across team members, easy setup, includes all required services

5. ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS
-------------------------

5.1 Server-Side Rendering
- Blade templates for server-side rendering
- Why SSR: Better SEO, faster initial load times, simpler state management for this type of application

5.2 Component-Based Architecture
- Modular Blade components for reusability
- Service layer pattern for business logic
- Repository pattern for data access (where applicable)

5.3 File Storage
- Local storage for development
- S3-compatible storage for production
- Separate disks for public and private files

6. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------------

6.1 Authentication
- Laravel's built-in authentication with sessions
- Role-based access control (Employee, Admin, Superadmin)
- CSRF protection on all forms

6.2 Data Protection
- Encrypted passwords with bcrypt
- SQL injection protection through Eloquent ORM
- XSS protection with Blade's automatic escaping

7. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS
----------------------------

7.1 Caching
- Redis support for session and cache storage
- Query caching for frequently accessed data
- View caching in production

7.2 Asset Optimization
- Vite handles code splitting and lazy loading
- Tailwind CSS purges unused styles
- Image optimization for uploads

8. WHY THIS STACK?
------------------

This technology stack was chosen for:

1. Rapid Development: Laravel's conventions and built-in features accelerate development
2. Maintainability: Clear structure, strong typing, and modern tooling make the codebase maintainable
3. Scalability: Queue system, caching, and proper database design allow for growth
4. Developer Experience: Modern tools like Vite, Tailwind, and Pest make development enjoyable
5. Community Support: All chosen technologies have strong communities and are actively maintained
6. Security: Laravel's security features and best practices are baked in
7. Cost-Effective: Open source technologies with optional commercial support

9. FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
